<h2>Who Organized is made for?</h2>
<p><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi-v3.organized-app.com%2Fapi%2Fv3%2Fpublic%2Fstats&amp;query=%24.countries.count&amp;label=Countries" alt="organized-countries" /> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi-v3.organized-app.com%2Fapi%2Fv3%2Fpublic%2Fstats&amp;query=%24.congregations&amp;label=Congregations" alt="organized-congregations" /> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi-v3.organized-app.com%2Fapi%2Fv3%2Fpublic%2Fstats&amp;query=%24.users&amp;label=Users" alt="organized-users" /></p>
<p>The app is designed to support appointed brothers in their responsibilities within the congregation, such as elders, ministerial servants, and pioneers. If the body of elders decides to implement the app, then publishers and midweek meeting students will also have access to it and be able to benefit from its features. However, if appointed brothers are not using the app, then publishers or pioneers will not be able to use it on their own. Be sure to obtain approval from your body of elders, as local circumstances and directions may vary.</p>
<h2>Device compatibility</h2>
<p>Organized is designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA), offering a seamless cross-platform experience. This makes it ideal for all users, and especially for users with less powerful devices or those using less common operating systems. A major benefit is that there is no operation system-lock, meaning you aren’t restricted to specific platforms or devices. This means it can run directly from your browser without needing to install anything, but you still have the option to add it to your device for easier access and offline use. PWAs combine the best of both web and native apps, making them fast, reliable, and convenient across multiple devices and platforms. As long as you have a modern web browser, you can run Organized smoothly on a smartphone, tablet, or computer with almost any OS.</p>
<p>To enhance your experience, you can also install Organized on your device. This adds an icon to your home screen, provides offline functionality, and offers a more app-like experience, similar to native apps. Simply open the app in your device’s browser and follow the prompt to add it to your home screen (or click <code>More/Share</code> button → <code>Install</code>).</p>
<h2>Is Organized a web-based app?</h2>
<p>The Organized app is not a typical online or cloud-based app. While it can be accessed via a web browser, it can also be downloaded and used locally on your device. The app is designed to store all data directly on your device, ensuring that your information remains in your hands and you can access the app offline.</p>
<p>An online server connection is only required for login purposes and to organize data sharing between congregation members. This connection is securely encrypted, guaranteeing the protection of your data. In essence, the Organized app combines the convenience of web access with the security and local storage of a downloaded application.</p>

<h2>Real-world benefits of using the app</h2>
<p>😌 <strong>Less stress</strong> – Publishers always know when they have assignments, and where to find all schedules and events. Appointed brothers have so much help with their duties, that they complete their tasks more easily, therefore with more joy.</p>
<p>⏳ <strong>Hundreds of saved hours</strong> – Significantly reduce time commitment for appointed brothers through automated features for reports, schedules, and more! Don’t spend much time on routine work that the program can do.</p>
<p>🌳 <strong>Digitalization</strong> – Less paper and ink waste for publishers and appointed brothers. Quicker updates of information for the whole congregation, more precise calculations, and less dependence on specific appointed brothers and their presence today.</p>
<p>📱️ <strong>Convenience</strong> – Enjoy full functionality seamlessly on any device – whether it's mobile or desktop. Organized allows publishers and appointed brothers to use the app on any device, anywhere. You can access the app either from a web browser or install it for the best experience.</p>

<p>All app data is stored just on your device initially. The data will be synced via a secure cloud connection if you want to share your schedules with your congregation or use Organized on multiple devices. The app doesn't store any confidential information, so it's never sent to the Internet. The data required for synchronization is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that neither the Organized app team nor anyone on the Internet can access it. In addition, all the data has multiple layers of data encryption on your device (so it's always encrypted before it gets synced) and various security measures like two-factor authentication, congregation data encryption, one-time invitation codes, app PIN, and more!</p>
<p>In accordance with <strong>GDPR</strong>, we collect only the most basic user data needed for authentication (such as name, email, device ID, and IP address) and process it with the utmost care. We obtain your consent for data collection, ensure its usage is transparent, and limit it to what is necessary. Users have the right to access, correct, and delete any of their data as required by GDPR.</p>
