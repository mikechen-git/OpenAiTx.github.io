<p>Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for
mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing
code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and
open source.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flutter.dev/get-started/">Install Flutter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/">Flutter documentation</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing to Flutter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For announcements about new releases, follow the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-announce">flutter-announce@googlegroups.com</a>
mailing list. Our documentation also tracks <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes">breaking
changes</a> across releases.</p>
<h2>Terms of service</h2>
<p>The Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By
downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service:
https://policies.google.com/terms</p>
<p>For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged
archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers
immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the <code>flutter</code> tool itself.
This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the <code>flutter upgrade</code> command).</p>
<h2>About Flutter</h2>
<p>We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android,
web, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of
your choice.</p>
<h3>Beautiful user experiences</h3>
<p>We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
Flutter's <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/resources/inside-flutter">layered architecture</a> gives you control over every pixel on the
screen and its powerful compositing capabilities let you overlay and animate
graphics, video, text, and controls without limitation. Flutter includes a full
<a href="https://flutter.dev/widgets/">set of widgets</a> that deliver pixel-perfect experiences whether
you're building for iOS (<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/cupertino">Cupertino</a>) or other platforms (<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets/material">Material</a>), along with
support for customizing or creating entirely new visual components.</p>

<h3>Fast results</h3>
<p>Flutter is fast. It's powered by hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
libraries like <a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a> (which underpins Chrome and Android) and
<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/impeller">Impeller</a>. We architected Flutter to
support glitch-free, jank-free graphics at the native speed of your device.</p>
<p>Flutter code is powered by the world-class <a href="https://dart.dev/">Dart platform</a>, which enables
compilation to 32-bit and 64-bit ARM machine code for iOS and Android,
JavaScript and WebAssembly for the web, as well as Intel x64 and ARM
for desktop devices.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/homepage/dart-diagram-small.png?raw=true" alt="Dart diagram"></p>
<h3>Productive development</h3>
<p>Flutter offers <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload">stateful hot reload</a>, allowing you to make changes to your code
and see the results instantly without restarting your app or losing its state.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/hot-reload"><img src="https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/main/src/content/assets/images/docs/tools/android-studio/hot-reload.gif?raw=true" alt="Hot reload animation" /></a></p>
<h3>Extensible and open model</h3>
<p>Flutter works with any development tool (or none at all), and also includes
editor plug-ins for both <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter">IntelliJ / Android Studio</a>.
Flutter provides <a href="https://pub.dev/flutter">tens of thousands of packages</a> to speed your
development, regardless of your target platform. And accessing other native code
is easy, with support for both FFI (<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/android/c-interop">on Android</a>, <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/ios/c-interop">on iOS</a>,
<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/macos/c-interop">on macOS</a>, and <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/windows/building#integrating-with-windows">on Windows</a>) as well as
<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/platform-channels">platform-specific APIs</a>.</p>
<p>Flutter is a fully open-source project, and we welcome contributions.
Information on how to get started can be found in our
<a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">contributor guide</a>.</p>
